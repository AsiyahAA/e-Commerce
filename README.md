# e-Commerce
## Description
### Project purpose was to create a back-end database for an e-commerce site and use node js, sequalize, and insomnia to display the data and to manipulate the data by adding, updating, and deleting the data. 
## User
### User should be able to run the server and view all data in insomnia. User should see requests for each category (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests) and be able to alter the data however they see fit (adding, updating, and deleting data). 
## Technologies
### GitHub was used to clone a new repository onto a computer and was also used to deploy the website when edits where finished and final version needed to be deployed. Visual Studio Code was used to create JS and SQL files and code from scratch. GitBash Terminal was used to git add/commit/push edits made from local repository onto GitHub to update respository.
## Setup
### Tools needed are GitHub to name and clone repository onto local computer/repository. GitBash Terminal should be installed and one can clone repository with either an SSH key or the HTML URL and with the command-git clone-and copying in the URL or SSH key, upload to Terminal-making sure they are not within another folder but in the main branch-and using the commands git add . (press enter) then git commit -m "detailed description of your edits" (press enter) then git push (press enter) and entering their SSH key if promted. 
### A new folder should be created and once Visual Studio Code is installed, open the new folder in VS and make new JS and SQL files if there is no starter code provided. Starter code folders should be copied onto your own repository. Run the commands npm init -y to get additional files needed (such as package.jon, gitignore, etc). Run npm i sequalize, and npm i express, and npm i mysql2 package from the mysql docs and once installed, run the command mysql -u root -p and enter your password once prompted. Afterward, in the terminal where mysql is loaded, you can exit and return to the server.js where you can run node "name of your file".js to view data in insomnia. Insomnia should be installed where data can be seen. Once all is installed, start coding and view all changes and progress made in the "Open Terminal" when you right click on the JS file and run node.
### GitBash Terminal is once again needed to updload edits made in your local repository onto GitHub-using the same commands of git add ./git commit -m/git push in order for the changes to be displayed.yed. 
### Screencastify was also used in recoridng a walk-through demostration of the employeeTracker.

## Status 
### e-Commerce is working sucessfully on rendering data for all categories, products, and tags (GET). Unfortunetly, running POST, PUT, and DELETE commands are not functioning correctly for all category, products, and tags, with only tags and category working slightly and products not working at all. This needs to be addressed in future work.
